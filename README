NOMADLAD provides Python interface to the blackbox optimization software 
NOMAD (version 4) available from https://github.com/bbopt/nomad repository.

Prerequisites

  - Python 3 (tested with version 3.12.4)
  - Boost.Python (tested with version 1.83)
  - Compiled NOMAD with static libraries (tested with version 4.4.0) 
  - GCC release that supports at least C++17 (tested with version 14.1.1)
  - Exported the NOMAD_PATH environment variable

Installation

  - Assuming the prerequisites are satisfied (remember to export NOMAD_PATH)
    it is possible to install (build) the package with Pip. 
  - In particular to install the (tagged) release v0.9.0 just execute

    pip install --user --upgrade \
      git+https://github.com/jan-provaznik/nomadlad.git@v0.9.0

Notes

  - Please note that the module requires the nomadStatic and sgtelibStatic
    libraries provided with NOMAD v4.4.x

Notes on minimal build of NOMAD 

  This is a considerably condensed version of the official installation guide
  adapted to the purpose of manually building this module.

  (Step 1) Download and extract the v4.4.0 release of NOMAD somewhere.

    wget https://github.com/bbopt/nomad/archive/refs/tags/v.4.4.0.tar.gz
    tar -zxf v.4.4.0.tar.gz

  (Step 2) Enter the nomad-v.4.4.0 directory

    cd nomad-v.4.4.0

  (Step 3) Export path to the current directory (needed for the final step)

    export NOMAD_PATH=$(pwd)

  (Step 3) Prepare and build NOMAD.

    cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_INTERFACE_PYTHON=ON -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=OFF -DTEST_OPENMP=OFF
    cmake --build build --config Release --clean-first --target nomadStatic --parallel

    Please note that you can set --parallel to the number of cores available. 

  (Step 5) Compile nomadlad module.
    
    Please note that NOMAD_PATH must be exported for this to work. 

    (Option A) Install directly from a tagged commit

      pip install --user --upgrade \
        git+https://github.com/jan-provaznik/nomadlad.git@v0.9.0

    (Option B) Install from locally cloned repository. Enter the repository first.

      python -m pip wheel -w dist -- .

  (Step 6) Profit.
