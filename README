NOMADLAD provides Python interface to the blackbox optimization software 
NOMAD (version 4) available from https://github.com/bbopt/nomad repository.

Prerequisites

  - Python 3 (tested with version 3.10.8)
  - Boost.Python (tested with version 1.80)
  - Successfully compiled and installed NOMAD (tested with version 4.3.1) 
  - GCC release that supports at least C++17 (tested with version 12.2.0)
  - Exported the NOMAD_HOME environment variable

Installation

  - Assuming the prerequisites are satisfied (remember to export NOMAD_HOME)
    it is possible to install (build) the package with Pip. 
  - In particular to install the (tagged) release v0.5.0 just execute

    pip install --user --upgrade \
      git+https://github.com/jan-provaznik/nomadlad.git@v0.5.1

Notes

  - Please note that the module links against the nomadEval, nomadAlgos and
    nomadUtils libraries. 
  - The library look-up paths are compiled into the module and set to
    $NOMAD_HOME/build/release/lib. 
  - Should you decide to move the NOMAD installation elsewhere, you must
    rebuild this module.

Notes on minimal installation of NOMAD 

  This is a considerably condensed version of the official installation guide
  at https://nomad-4-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/v.4.3.1/Installation.html
  and results in a minimal installation of NOMAD without any interfaces.

  (Step 1) Enter the directory where you want NOMAD to be built and installed.

    cd /the/target/directory

  (Step 2) Download and extract the v4.3.1 release.

    wget https://github.com/bbopt/nomad/archive/refs/tags/v.4.3.1.tar.gz
    tar -zxf v.4.3.1.tar.gz

  (Step 3) Enter the nomad-v4.3.1 directory and export the path as NOMAD_HOME.

    cd nomad-v4.3.1
    export NOMAD_HOME=$(pwd)

  (Step 4) Prepare, build and install NOMAD.

    cmake -S . -B build/release
    cmake --build build/release --parallel 4
    cmake --install build/release

    Please note that you can set --parallel to the number of cores available.

  (Step 5) Compile and install nomadlad.
    
    Please note that NOMAD_HOME must be exported for this to work.

    pip install --user --upgrade \
      git+https://github.com/jan-provaznik/nomadlad.git@v0.5.1

  (Step 6) Profit.
