                      Example: a simple blackbox function

Problem statement

  minimize
    sqrt((x - 1) ** 2 + (y - 1) ** 2)
  subject to
    sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2) >= 2
  with (x, y) bound to
    0 < x < 5
    0 < y < 5

Analytic solution

  Using the method of Lagrange multipliers the location of the minimum is
  revealed at (sqrt(2), sqrt(2)).

Blackbox formulation compatible with NOMAD

  In NOMAD positive constraint functions violate the constraints they
  represent. We therefore define the blackbox as follows.

  - Objective  function: f(w) = numpy.linalg.norm(w - 1, 2)
  - Constraint function: c(w) = 2 - numpy.linalg.norm(w, 2)

Parametrization of NOMAD

  We use the standard parameters. The following are of particular interest.

  - The MAX_BB_EVAL sets the evaluation budget.
  - The BB_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE sets the maximal size of evaluation blocks.
  - The BB_OUTPUT_TYPE determines the output format of the blackbox evaluator.

Notes

  In this example the block is evaluated in parallel using a pool of processes
  communicating through MPI. The example is started with a BASH wrapper. 

  One may supply a custom hostfile or set remote hosts manually.
